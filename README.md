## Theory

### General AI principle

Y: A label is the thing we're predicting

X: A feature is an input variable (can be a list)

x: An example is a particular instance of data (a vector of values for a feature)

A labeled example includes both feature(s) and the label.

An unlabeled example contains features but not the label.

Once we've trained our model with labeled examples, we use that model to predict the label on unlabeled examples.

General AI equation: Y = wX + b
